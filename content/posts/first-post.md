I created this blog as a programming project and an introduction to blogging. It won't be a super focused blog on any single niche, but more of an amalgamation of all my interests. I hope to keep a journal of my journey as a developer, and my life in general.

I hope with my shotgun approach you'll find something useful or interesting.
